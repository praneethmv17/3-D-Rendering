		Project Week 6/Final Week
--------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

1.) Open “project_final.html”.

2.) For Translate tab in the 3-D Transformations, move slider along X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis 
    to move the slider around to move the cube around the respective axes.

3.) For Rotate tab in 3-D Transformations, move slider along X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis 
    to move the slider around to rotate the cube around the respective axes.

4.) For Shear Tab in 3-D Transformations, select the options in the dropdown 
    to shear the cube along the respective axes. 
    Click “Refresh” button(present at the end of the Controls) after each Shear 
    to reset the cube since it shears freshly and not on already sheared cube.

5.) For Views/Projections Tab, select the options in the dropdown 
    to select the views for the cube. 
    Click “Refresh” button(present at the end of the Controls) after each View 
    to reset the cube as it takes the front face into consideration each time a View is selected.

6.) For Point Light Tab, select the options in the dropdown to select the PointLight positions for the cube.

7.) For Ambient Light Tab, Click the colour on the slider to select Ambient Light colour.

8.) For Vanishing Points Tab, select the options in the dropdown 
    to select the number of Vanishing Points for the cube. 
    Click “Refresh” button(present at the end of the Controls) after each option 
    to reset the cube as it takes the front face into consideration each time an option is selected.

9.) For Textures Tab, select the options in the dropdown to select the Textures for the cube.
    Click “Refresh” button(present at the end of the Controls) for the Default Texture.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1.) While selecting anything from “Views/Projections” tab or “Vanishing Points” tab or “Shear” tab, 
    it is better to keep “Cube Textures”, “Floor/Environment” at default. If you plan to change these, 
    change them before you select anything from “Views/Projections” tab or “Vanishing Points” tab or “Shear” tab. 
    It is best to not rotate/move the cube while you are selecting from these tabs.

2.) Also, while selecting from “Views/Projections” tab or “Vanishing Points” tab or “Shear” tab, 
    always click on “Refresh” button(present at the end of the Controls) before you 
    click on another selection from these because the program takes the default view into consideration 
    every time an option among these is clicked. So, when you click on “Refresh”, 
    it takes the cube into its default position.

3.) Select ‘Top of Cube’ option from “Point Light” tab before performing any operation for best lighting.

4.) You can rotate the cube and stage by left-clicking on the cube/stage and dragging it across screen. 

5.) You can move the whole setup of the cube and the stage by right-clicking on the screen and dragging across. 
    Release the right-click to place the setup.
